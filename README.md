# Tree Data Structures

This repository contains implementations of various tree data structures, each serving different use cases. Here, you'll find examples and educational content on Binary Search Trees, Tries, and Merkle Trees. Each structure is accompanied by comments to aid in understanding their construction, operation, and application.

## Overview

Tree data structures organize data hierarchically and are essential for efficient data storage, retrieval, and manipulation. This repo covers the following trees:

- **Binary Search Tree (BST)**: A binary tree where each node has at most two children, and every node's left child is less than the parent node, while the right child is greater.
- **Trie (Prefix Tree)**: A tree used to store a dynamic set or associative array where the keys are usually strings. It's incredibly efficient for searching words in dictionaries, auto-completion systems, and prefix matching.
- **Merkle Tree**: A tree in which every leaf node is labelled with the cryptographic hash of a data block, and every non-leaf node is labelled with the hash of the labels of its child nodes. Merkle Trees are crucial in blockchain for ensuring data integrity.

## Features

- Detailed implementations of each tree structure.
- Comments explaining key concepts and operations.
- Example usage demonstrating how to work with each tree.
- Functions to insert, search, and traverse the trees.
